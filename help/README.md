# CLI Help files

Threatcode CLI Help files are managed by GitBook connected to the [threatcode/user-docs](https://github.com/threatcode/user-docs) repository.

It's recommended to make all CLI Help changes there. Changes from GitBook are automatically [synced to the Threatcode CLI repository with a GitHub Action](https://github.com/threatcode/threatcode/actions/workflows/sync-cli-help-to-user-docs.yml). The Action creates a PR that needs to be approved and merged. This Action could also be manually triggered.

If you need to make changes tied to a specific PR, you can make them in this repository first, merge the changes and then move them over to the GitBook.

CLI help files are a standard Markdown.
