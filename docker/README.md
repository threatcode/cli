# Deprecation Notice

Please note, these Docker images are deprecated and may be removed in the future. They remain available only to provide continuity for legacy Threatcode integrations. **Threatcode does not recommend their use.**

Instead, please use the [`threatcode/threatcode`](https://hub.docker.com/r/threatcode/threatcode) Docker images. These images wrap the Threatcode CLI and depending on the Tag come with a relevant tooling for different projects. [See the threatcode/images on GitHub for more details and examples](https://github.com/threatcode/threatcode-images).
